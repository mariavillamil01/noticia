                <p>The “State of CSS 2019” report, based on a survey of 11,307 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) developers in 135 countries, has been released by developers Sacha Greif and Raphael Benitte. The survey identifies which CSS features and tools the developers use and which they prefer. Nearly 32 percent of respondents had been writing CSS for five to 10 years while 27.07 percent had been writing CSS for 10 to 20 years. CSS, now 22 years old, has evolved over the years to include capabilities such as grids, for specifying complex layouts, and blend modes, masks, and shapes, for implementing richer designs.
